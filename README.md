Makhanyi's Fast Food Website 🍔🔥


This is a simple e-commerce-style website inspired by Makhanyi's Fast Food, my favorite local spot known for serving the best food in our kasi! 🙌

I created this project to sharpen my skills in building clean, responsive, and engaging e-commerce websites using real-world inspiration. The design and layout reflect the love I have for their meals and the vibe of our community.


💻 What I learned:

Structuring a basic online food ordering layout

Enhancing UI/UX with a kasi feel

Improving my frontend dev skills

Just a passion project with flavor 🍟💥
